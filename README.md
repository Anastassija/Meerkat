# Meerkat

Meerkat is a library of general, practical parser combinators in Scala. 

At the moment, the Meerkat library is a prototype, and we are trying to fix the remaining
issues and complete the documentation **in the coming weeks**. In the meantime, if you encounter
any problem, please open an issue or contact us.

Currently the only way to use the Meerkat library is to build it from the source.
You need to first install [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/). To build the Meerkat library,
clone this repository, and run `sbt package`.

More information about the Meerkat libary can be found in [Wiki](https://github.com/Anastassija/Meerkat/wiki).

The grammars written using the Meerkat library are available [here](https://github.com/afroozeh/Meerkat-Grammars).

The Meerkat library is created by Anastasia Izmaylova and Ali Afroozeh and is released under the BSD license.
