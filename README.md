# Meerkat

Meerkat is a library of general, practical parser combinators in Scala. 

At the moment, the Meerkat library is a prototype, and we are trying to fix the remaining
issues and complete the documentation **in the coming weeks**. If you have any questions regarding
running Meerkat parsers, please contact us.

More information about the Meerkat libary can be found in [Wiki](https://github.com/Anastassija/Meerkat/wiki).

The grammars written using the Meerkat library are available [here](https://github.com/afroozeh/Meerkat-Grammars).

The Meerkat library is created by Anastasia Izmaylova and Ali Afroozeh and is released under the BSD license.
